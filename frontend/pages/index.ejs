                        <p>
                            The backend of this website is written in <a href="https://deno.land/">Deno</a>.
                            This is a JavaScript runtime with built-in TypeScript support using <a
                                href="https://v8.dev/">V8</a>.
                            Deno is built in Rust and was created by Ryan Dahl (the former creator of <a
                                href="https://nodejs.org/en/">NodeJS</a>).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The frontend is written in <a href="https://ejs.co/">EJS</a>. It's a simple templating
                            langague where you can generate HTML with JavaScript.
                            The HTML is then rendered by an ejs render engine in Deno.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To save the entries in the visitors book the backend is using a <a
                                href="https://www.mongodb.com/">MongoDB</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Deno application and the database run both in separate <a
                                href="https://www.docker.com/">docker</a> containers to make the setup as simple and
                            fast as possible on multiple different architectures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This website runs on my VPS which is based in Frankfurt and is exposed by <a
                                href="https://doc.traefik.io/">Traefik</a>, a reverse proxy and load balancer for a easy
                            deployment of microservices.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            For automation and testing purposes the website works with a ci/cd pipeline. This pipeline
                            is realized with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions">GitHub Actions</a>.
                            Everytime a <a href="https://github.com/RobertFent/myDenoWebsite/pulls">pull request</a> is
                            created or changes to a pull request are pushed, the pipeline
                            runs and after successful tests a new ci build os pushed to <a
                                href="https://hub.docker.com/">Dockerhub</a>.
                            Merging a PR into the develop branch leads to a new build of the website and pushing this
                            build with the tag :dev while merging a PR into the master branch leads to the same except
                            that the build is pushed with the tag :latest.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To detect new builds of the website, on my server runs an application in docker called <a
                                href="https://github.com/containrrr/watchtower">watchtower</a>.
                            This application listens for new builds, pulls them and recreates the container running the
                            build if a new build is released.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The newest release of the :dev tag runs <a
                                href="https://dev-website.robertfent.dev/">here</a> while the newest :latest release
                            runs <a href="https://website.robertfent.dev/">here</a>.
                            While a pull request into develop is open in my GitHub <a
                                href="https://github.com/RobertFent/myDenoWebsite">repo</a> the current state is
                            released under the :ci tag <a href="https://ci-website.robertfent.dev/">here</a>.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The current production version is represented in the <a
                                href="https://github.com/RobertFent/myDenoWebsite/tree/master">master branch</a>, while
                            the current
                            develop version is represented in the <a
                                href="https://github.com/RobertFent/myDenoWebsite/tree/develop">develop branch</a>.
                            To add changes to the develop version a seperated branch has to be created und a pull
                            request have to be opened. After opening a PR a workflow which builds the website in docker
                            and runs tests against it is run. If the workflow runs successfully the PR can be merged
                            into develop. Ideally an <a
                                href="https://github.com/RobertFent/myDenoWebsite/issues">issue</a> with one of my issue
                            templates should be created and a PR should close exactly one issue.

                                Hello, my name is Robert. I am 23 years old and have a bachelor's degree in media
                                informatics. This winter I will start the master in computer science.
                            </p>
                            <p class="h7">IT Experience</p>
                            <p>
                                I worked for nearly two years as a full stack developer at the former startup DioVision
                                Systems GmbH where we developed a time tracking tool for the pharma company Fresenius
                                Kabi.
                                While working on my bachelor degree in media informatics I had to do some projects
                                including
                                developing an app on Android with <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio">Android
                                    Studio</a>, an online voice chat running in a browser, a search engine in Java using

                                <a href="https://www.elastic.co/de/elastic-stack/">elastic stack</a> and a Python
                                program
                                which may predict the weather using linear regression.
